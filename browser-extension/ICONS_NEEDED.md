# Icons Needed

The extension needs three icon sizes:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)  
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Quick Solution: Use Emoji as Icon

You can use an online tool to create icons from emoji:

1. Go to: https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/
2. Search for: 🎯 or ⚽ or 🏆
3. Download the icons
4. Rename them to `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`
5. Place them in the `browser-extension` folder

## Or Create Your Own

Design suggestions:
- Use the KC München colors (purple/blue gradient)
- Include a soccer table or trophy symbol
- Keep it simple and recognizable

## Temporary Workaround

For now, you can:
1. Find any 3 PNG files
2. Rename them to `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`
3. The extension will work, just with placeholder icons

The extension functionality works without proper icons, but Chrome will show a warning.
